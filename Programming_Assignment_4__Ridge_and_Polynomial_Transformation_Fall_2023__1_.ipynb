    "\n",
    "In 10-fold cross-validation, the dataset is randomly divided into ten parts or folds. The idea is to iteratively train the model on 9 of these folds and test it on the tenth. This is done ten times, once for each fold acting as the validation set. By doing so, we're ensuring that each data point gets to be in a validation set exactly once.\n",

However, in the context of our analysis, given the relatively small size of the dataset and the possibility of unequal numbers of samples in each fold, this traditional approach might not be mathematically rigorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, our approach for calculating the cross-validation error will deviate slightly from the traditional method. Instead of merely averaging the errors from each fold, we will sum up the errors across all folds and then divide by $ N $, the total number of training examples. This ensures that our error estimate is unbiased and takes into account the potential discrepancy in the number of samples across different folds.\n",
